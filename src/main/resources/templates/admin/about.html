                <p>Each day, thousands of people – people just like you – provide compassionate care to those in need.
                    Our network
                    of generous donors, volunteers and employees share a mission of preventing and relieving suffering,
                    here at home
                    and around the world.<br>

                    We roll up our sleeves and donate time, money and blood. We learn or teach life-saving skills so our
                    communities
                    can be better prepared when the need arises.

                <p><br>We immediately respond to communities impacted by natural disasters by engaging volunteers,
                    partners and local
                    communities to help families rebuild homes, by engaging in activities like “mucking and gutting”
                    after a flood, “rubbling” after an earthquake, or safe demolition to remove dangerous structures. We
                    begin by
                    carefully listening to the community to identify its greatest needs, and only then, create a
                    long-term action
                    plan, executed with speed and real-time problem-solving.

                <p>Where needed, we make a long-term commitment and engage our trained volunteers to work with the
                    community to
                    rebuild disaster-resilient homes, schools, daycare facilities and community centers – the hubs of
                    every
                    community. By providing a free and open door for every volunteer around the globe, (as well as
                    cutting-edge
                    training), we transform the good hearts and willing hands of our volunteers into a powerful team
                    that can jump
                    in and create an immediate impact in disaster-affected areas.</p>

                    buildings to code, we ensure they are stronger and more resilient in the face of future disasters,
                    in turn preserving the future which we are rebuilding for the community.</p>

                <p>We live in the communities where we serve and become a part of them. As we do, our volunteers uncover
                    new ways to help, which invariably brings new ideas and creative solutions. We encourage our
                    volunteers to follow through on these ideas where feasible. Projects have included everything from
                    weekly movie nights for kids in Malawi, English tutoring sessions in the Philippines,
                    entrepreneurial and financial classes for secondary school girls in Peru, and Thanksgiving dinners
                    for hundreds of flood victims in Detroit.</p>
